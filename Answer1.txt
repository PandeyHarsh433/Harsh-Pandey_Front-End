1 - The List component is a simple React component that renders an unordered list of items. Each item in the list is represented by a ListItem component, which receives several props from the List component:
	a - text: a string representing the text to be displayed for the item.
	b - index: a number representing the index of the item in the items array.
	c - isSelected: a boolean flag indicating whether the item is currently selected or not.
	d - onClickHandler: a callback function that is called when the item is clicked.
The List component receives an array of items as a prop. This array contains objects that have a text property, which represents the text to be displayed for the item.When the List component renders, it maps over the items array and creates a ListItem component for each item. It passes the text, index, isSelected, and onClickHandler props to each ListItem component.The List component maintains the selected index in its state using the useState hook. Initially, the selected index is set to null. When a ListItem is clicked, the handleClick function is called with the index of the clicked item as an argument. This function sets the selected index to the clicked item's index.The isSelected prop is passed to each ListItem component based on whether its index matches the selected index in the List component's state. If the selected index matches the item's index, then the isSelected prop is set to true, causing the ListItem to display a green background. If the selected index does not match the item's index, then the isSelected prop is set to false, causing the ListItem to display a red background.
